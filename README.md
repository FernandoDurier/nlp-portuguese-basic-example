In order to use this repo, be sure you are using the correct Python version (preferrebly greater than 3).
I like to use pyenv (https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) in my machine. 
And for the MAC users beware of the versions, for you I recommend using also the Homebrew (https://docs.brew.sh/Installation).
